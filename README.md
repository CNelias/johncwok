👋 Hi! I’m Corentin, a physicist and musician with a keen interest for data science. 
Over the course of my PhD, I did quite a lot of programming, some of which you can see on this page. <br/>
📚 Some topics I am particularly found of are the dynamics of neuronal populations, solid state physics, general relativity and jazz. <br/>
🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to theoritical/computational neuroscience.
